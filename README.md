# CampusNav

For a first time visitor to a campus, navigating the very complex architectural plan in an optimal manner may seem a challenge. Without proper guiding or navigation boards, it may seem difficult. This project introduces a navigation system using AR and SLAM algorithm toolkits to provide an easy path to any destination within the campus. With just a phone camera, the user is able to navigate through the campus with real time instructions to reach a particular destination as inputted.
